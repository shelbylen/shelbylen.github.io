		<h2 style="color:blueviolet">italian cuisine</h2>
		<p style="color:blue">my favorite cuisine is italian cuisine. During my semester abroad I got to take a week long vacation to Italy, where I learned firsthand their dedication to fine ingredients and seasonal dishes. Another thing I appreciate about Italian cuisine is that it's relatively simple, and most popular dishes have a working class history. This makes recreating delicious Italian dishes at home very easy.</p>
